# HELTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION

## Cross Sell and Up Sell

### Cross Sell
Cross-selling is the action or practice of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer. In practice, businesses define cross-selling in many different ways. Elements that might influence the definition might include the size of the business, the industry sector it operates within and the financial motivations of those required to define the term. The objective of cross-selling can be either to increase the income derived from the client or to protect the relationship with the client or clients. The approach to the process of cross-selling can be varied. Unlike the acquiring of new business, cross-selling involves an element of risk that existing relationships with the client could be disrupted. For that reason, it is important to ensure that the additional product or service being sold to the client or clients enhances the value the client or clients get from the organization. In practice, large businesses usually combine cross-selling and up-selling techniques to increase revenue.

### Up sell
Upselling is a sales technique where a seller invites the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons to generate more revenue. While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered (A different technique is cross-selling in which a seller tries to sell something else). In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize revenue.

### Upselling vs Cross-selling
Upselling is the practice in which a business tries to motivate customers to purchase a higher-end product, an upgrade, or an additional item in order to make a more profitable sale. For instance, a salesperson may influence a customer into purchasing the newest version of an item, rather than the less-expensive current model, by pointing out its additional features. A similar marketing technique is cross-selling, where the salesperson suggests the purchase of additional products for sale. For example, he might say "Would you like some ice cream to go with that cake?" Both techniques increase profits for businesses, but research has shown that upselling is generally more effective than cross-selling. Cross-selling means to offer more services to existing customer and upselling means enhance sale by describing features of new product.

## Context

The Insurance All Company
Disclaimer: The following context is completely fictional, the company, the context, the CEO, the business questions exist only in my imagination.

Insurance All is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: Vehicle Insurance.

As with health insurance, customers of this new Vehicle Insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, aimed at the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey of about 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers expressed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127 thousand new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive the offer of the new auto insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through telephone calls.

However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20 thousand calls within the campaign period.

## The challenge

In that context, you were hired as a Data Science consultant to build a model that predicts whether or not the customer would be interested in auto insurance.

With its solution, the sales team hopes to be able to prioritize the people with the greatest interest in the new product and, thus, optimize the campaign by making only contacts with customers most likely to make the purchase.

As a result of your consultancy, you will need to deliver a report containing some analysis and answers to the following questions:

Main insights on the most relevant attributes of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance.

What percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to reach by making 20,000 calls?

And if the sales team's capacity increases to 40,000 calls, what percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to contact?

How many calls does the sales team need to make to contact 80% of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance?
